# HMM-Weather

<p>Constructed a HMM by manually calculating the model parameters, including hidden state transitional probability matrix and emission probability matrix. Investigate model utility including inferring hidden states given observations, and generating sample observations and hidden states based on the system dynamics.</p>
<p>Constructed another HMM by fitting the model parameters using a sequence of observation data. Then proceed to investigate model utility same as above.</p>
